        <p className="mb-4">
          Mediacrater provides a Chrome extension that lets users select, preview, download,
          organize, and optionally scan video advertisements found in the Facebook Ads Library.
          We are operated as Mediacrater and can be reached at{' '}

          </a>.
        </p>

          This policy applies specifically to the Mediacrater Chrome extension. Our web app is
          also governed by the main Mediacrater{' '}

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What Data the Extension Handles</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The extension handles only the information needed to provide its user-facing features.
          Some information is stored locally in your browser, while account, billing, and
          user-requested scan information is transmitted to Mediacrater service providers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Account and authentication data</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Email address and user ID</strong> — used to authenticate you, associate the
            extension with your Mediacrater account, and retrieve your plan and feature access.
            Stored and processed through Supabase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password</strong> — transmitted directly to Supabase when you sign in. Supabase
            processes and protects your password through its authentication system. Mediacrater
            cannot view your password in plain text.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication tokens</strong> — session and refresh tokens are stored in
            Chrome extension local storage to keep you signed in. They are transmitted to
            Supabase and Mediacrater services only when required to authenticate an account
            request. They are removed from extension storage when you sign out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plan and account information</strong> — your plan name, remaining scan balance,
            audio-analysis availability, batch-download access, local-library access, and Stripe
            customer status may be retrieved to display and enforce the features included with
            your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extension version</strong> — the installed extension version is associated with
            your user ID in Supabase so we can manage compatibility, entitlement changes, and
            support issues. The last reported version is also stored locally to prevent redundant
            reports.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Facebook Ads Library content</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Visible video information</strong> — when you activate selection mode on a
            Facebook Ads Library page, the extension examines visible video elements so you can
            select a specific advertisement. It may access the video source URL and poster image
            URL made available to your browser by Facebook.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Selected-video records</strong> — the source URL, poster URL, selection time,
            and a randomly generated local record ID are stored in Chrome extension local storage
            so your selections remain available in the side panel until you remove or clear them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Page access limitations</strong> — the selector operates only on Facebook Ads
            Library pages. The extension does not read Facebook messages, account credentials,
            private posts, or general browsing history.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Downloads and previews</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Video downloads</strong> — when you click Download, the selected video URL is
            passed to Chrome's download manager and the file is saved to your device. Mediacrater
            does not receive or retain an ordinary download merely because you downloaded it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Video previews</strong> — previews load the selected video from its source URL
            directly into the extension interface. Previewing does not upload the video to
            Mediacrater.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Local creative library</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If your plan includes the local creative library, the following information is stored
          on your device using the browser's IndexedDB storage:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>The saved video file and its locally generated low-resolution thumbnail</li>
          <li>The source URL, source host, poster URL, file type, file size, and saved date</li>
          <li>The title, folder assignment, folder colour, tags, notes, and favourite status</li>
          <li>Your Mediacrater user ID, used locally to separate libraries between signed-in users</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Local-library videos and organizational information are not uploaded to Mediacrater
          merely because you save or organize them. They remain on the device where they were
          saved unless you explicitly choose to scan a video.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Extension settings and technical data</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Extension settings</strong> — your selector shortcut, theme preference,
            selector state, and selected-video list are stored locally so the extension functions
            as configured.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Browser identifier</strong> — the extension generates a random identifier and
            stores it locally. It is not used to monitor your activity on other websites.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security and request information</strong> — our infrastructure providers may
            process standard technical information such as IP address, User-Agent, timestamps,
            request headers, and security signals when you authenticate, manage billing, or run a
            scan. This information is used to deliver and protect the service.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Optional policy scans</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Scan content</strong> — a video is submitted for analysis only when you click
            Scan. The extension loads the selected video in your browser, extracts representative
            video frames, and may extract its audio track if audio analysis is enabled for your
            account. The extracted frames and optional audio are transmitted securely to
            Mediacrater for analysis. The extension does not transmit the complete original video
            file to Mediacrater as part of this extension scan workflow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scan metadata</strong> — we may process and store your user ID, plan, selected
            platform, scan type, generated scan and queue identifiers, file name, timestamps,
            processing duration, payload size, scan status, token usage, and returned results.
            This information is used to provide scan results, manage queues and balances, display
            scan history where available, diagnose technical problems, and evaluate support or
            refund requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI processing</strong> — the extracted frames, optional audio, and related text
            instructions are sent to third-party AI model providers solely to perform the scan.
            These providers may process data in countries other than your own and may retain it
            according to their own terms and legal obligations. They do not receive ordinary
            downloaded or locally organized videos unless you explicitly submit the video for a
            scan.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section className="mb-10">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Payment Data</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Checkout and billing portal</strong> — when you choose to purchase or manage a
            plan, the extension requests a secure Stripe checkout or billing-portal session and
            opens the Stripe-hosted page in your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit card and billing information</strong> — payment details are collected
            and processed exclusively by Stripe. Mediacrater does not receive or store your full
            card number or security code.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase and subscription records</strong> — we store information needed to
            identify your subscription, apply your plan and scan balance, provide billing support,
            and comply with tax and accounting obligations. Records required for Canadian tax and
            accounting compliance may be retained for six years from the end of the applicable tax
            year, including after account deletion.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Data We Do Not Sell or Use for Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell or rent extension user data. We do not use Facebook Ads Library content,
          downloaded videos, locally saved library content, authentication information, or scan
          content for targeted advertising, credit decisions, or purposes unrelated to the

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>activeTab</strong> — verifies that the active page is the Facebook Ads Library
            and communicates with that page when you activate the selector.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>downloads</strong> — saves videos selected by you through Chrome's download
            manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>scripting</strong> — loads the selector script and styles into the active Ads

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>storage and unlimitedStorage</strong> — stores authentication sessions,

            your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>sidePanel</strong> — displays the Mediacrater interface in Chrome's side panel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Host access</strong> — limited to Mediacrater services, Facebook Ads Library

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Selected-video records</strong> — remain in extension local storage until you

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local creative library</strong> — videos, thumbnails, folders, tags, notes, and
            related metadata remain in IndexedDB until you delete them, clear extension storage,
            or uninstall the extension. Signing out does not automatically erase the local
            library.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication tokens</strong> — retained locally until they expire, are
            invalidated, or you sign out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account, entitlement, and extension-version information</strong> — retained
            while your account remains active and as needed to operate and secure the service.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scan metadata and results</strong> — retained with your account as needed to
            provide scan history, diagnostics, security, balance accounting, and support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Extracted scan media</strong> — used to complete the requested analysis and not

            infrastructure providers may retain information according to their own policies and
            legal obligations.

          <li>
            <strong>Legally required records</strong> — billing, transaction, fraud-prevention, and

            applicable law.
