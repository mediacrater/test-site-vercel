        <p>
          Mediacrater is a Chrome extension that scans video and image ads for policy violations
          across platforms including Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and X. We are operated as
          Mediacrater and can be reached at{' '}

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We collect only what is necessary to operate the service. Below is a complete list of
          the data we collect, why we collect it, and how it is stored.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Account Data</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Email address</strong> — collected at registration to identify your account
            and communicate with you about your service. Stored securely via Supabase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Token balance</strong> — the number of scan tokens available on your account.
            Updated after each scan and each purchase. Stored via Supabase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase records</strong> — when you make a purchase, we store the session ID,
            number of tokens purchased, and purchase amount. This is used to credit your account
            correctly and to support refund requests. Stored via Supabase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scan metadata</strong> — when you run a scan, we log the timestamp, tokens
            consumed, platform selected, content type (video or image), and analysis duration.
            No ad content, video files, or images are ever stored. This data is used solely to
            diagnose technical issues and to evaluate refund requests. Stored via Supabase.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Queue metadata</strong> — Our queuing system is designed to allocate our limited 
            server resources appropriately so everyone gets a chance to scan their ads. When you run 
            a scan and you're placed in our queuing system, we generate a queue ID and your scan
            metadata is logged with it. This includes your plan, user ID, scan type, content type, status,
            timestamps, how long you waited in queue and payload size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password</strong> — your password is encrypted using Supabase's authentication
            system. We cannot view, access, or modify your password at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication tokens</strong> — session tokens used to keep you logged in are
            stored locally on your device via Chrome's secure storage API. They are never transmitted
            to or stored on our servers beyond what Supabase requires for session management.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Device address</strong> — we collect your device IP address at the time of account creation solely to prevent abuse of our free tier. Read more about this in our{' '}

            <strong>Credit card and billing information</strong> — all payment processing is handled

            Stripe is PCI-DSS compliant and maintains its own security standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purchase and transaction records</strong> — retained for 6 years 
            from the end of the tax year in which the transaction occurred, as required 
            by the Canada Revenue Agency for tax and accounting compliance. This applies 
            even if you delete your account.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Video and image files</strong> — files you submit for scanning are transmitted
            to our servers solely for policy analysis. They are permanently and automatically deleted
            the moment your scan results are returned to the extension. We do not store, retain,
            review, or use your creative assets for any purpose beyond the scan you requested.
