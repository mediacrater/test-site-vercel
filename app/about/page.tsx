            I used to run dropshipping ads. I lost thousands to sudden bans with zero clear explanation.

            <p>
              A few years ago I was deep in dropshipping. Like many, I spent hours testing products, writing copy, and burning ad budgets only to wake up to account restrictions or outright bans with no real feedback from Meta or TikTok.
            </p>

            <p>
			  I never found out what triggered the violations because I never got feedback. I learned the hard way which words, images, and claims were red flags. But you don't have to follow in my footsteps. One wrong creative could cost hundreds or thousands in lost revenue and wasted spend.
			</p>

            <p>
              Eventually I got tired of the guessing game. I wanted a tool that could scan an ad creative <em>before</em> I hit submit, something that would tell me exactly which policies I was breaking and why, so I could fix it and move on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nothing like that existed at the price point or simplicity I needed. So I built it myself.

            <p>
              Mediacrater is a straightforward browser extension and web tool that lets media buyers, freelancers, and small agencies:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
              <li>Upload video or image creatives</li>
              <li>Select the platform (Meta, TikTok, Google Ads, YouTube, etc.)</li>
              <li>Get an instant list of policy violations (if any) + a confidence score</li>
              <li>Fix issues before wasting budget on rejected ads</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="mt-6">
              No AI hype. No black-box magic. Just clear, actionable feedback so you stop guessing and start scaling.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why Privacy-First Matters to Me</h3>
            
            <p>
              I hated how much data ad platforms already collect. I didn’t want to build something that made the problem worse. That’s why everything runs locally on your device. We don’t store your creatives for extended periods of time, and even then, it’s anonymized and deleted immediately.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Who This Is For</h3>
            
            <p>
              Freelance media buyers, small agencies, DTC brands, and anyone running paid ads who’s tired of:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
              <li>Sudden account restrictions with zero explanation</li>
              <li>Wasting hours appealing vague violations</li>
              <li>Losing money on ads that never get approved</li>
            </ul>

              <p className="text-lg font-medium text-center">
                If you've ever screamed at your screen after seeing "Ad rejected" this tool was built for you.
